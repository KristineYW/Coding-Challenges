However, it didn't pass about half the tests due to a time-out error so I had to find a different, optimized solution. Since the range of the potentially squared numbers is exponentially (literally) larger than that of the square roots of those values, a better solution I thought of was to minimize the range to check by using the floored values of the square roots of a and b.
